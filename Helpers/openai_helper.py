- What guild are you in?
- Why do you want to become a community member of TAq?
- What would you contribute to the community?

- Link to stats page (wynncraft.com/stats)
- Age (optional)
- Estimated playtime per day
- Previous guild experience (name, rank, reason for leaving)

- What do you know about TAq?
- What would you like to gain from joining TAq?
- What would you contribute to TAq?
- Anything else? (optional)
- How did you learn about TAq / reference for application

If the message answers several of these questions in a structured way, it IS an application.
If it is a short greeting, question, casual chat, or unrelated message, it is NOT an application.
