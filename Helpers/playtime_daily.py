"""Derive playtime_daily from the player_activity snapshot history.

player_activity stores a cumulative counter once a day, so the playtime spent
on a given day is the difference between that day's snapshot and the previous
one. This module owns that derivation so the nightly task and the CLI backfill
cannot drift apart on the rules.

Three things make it more than a LAG():

  * Missing snapshots. The daily task can skip a run, and a member who leaves
    and rejoins has no rows in between — spans of up to six months exist. The
    delta is spread evenly across the span and marked 'interpolated', because
    the shape inside the span is unknowable.
  * Negative deltas. Rows go backwards on uuid reuse or an API correction, and
    on 2026-04-25 Wynncraft revised ~95 members' playtime downward at once.
    Those are floored to zero and marked 'clamped' rather than subtracting
    from a member's total.
  * Impossible deltas. A day cannot hold more than 24 hours, but the counter
    sometimes says otherwise. Those are clipped and marked 'capped', so a
    truncated day is never mistaken for a merely busy one.
