"""Single source of truth for the Discord role names tied to TAq guild membership.

Before this module, the registration flows (/new_member, the NewMember modal,
auto-registration) and the removal flows (/reset_roles, the "Member | Remove"
user command, the website promotion queue) each carried their own copy of the
role lists, and they drifted: renamed roles kept their old spelling, new roles
never got added (TAQ-67). Every flow now plans its role changes here.

Several names carry invisible U+2800 (braille blank) padding that fakes section
headers in the sidebar, so those are built from escapes with an explicit count
rather than pasted literals. All names were verified character-for-character
against the prod guild's role list on 2026-08-20 (TAQ-51 / TAQ-67).
