"""
Recruiter tracking & payouts (DB-backed, replaces the old Sheets integration).

  1. Guild app accepted, recruiter matched -> record_pending_recruit() inserts
     a pending row (Commands/app_commands.py::_process_recruiter_tracking).
  2. Recruit hits Piranha -> credit_piranha_promotion() (called from the four
     promotion pathways) claims the pending row and posts the payout embed.
  3. Recruit leaves first -> void_pending_recruit() kills the pending row.
