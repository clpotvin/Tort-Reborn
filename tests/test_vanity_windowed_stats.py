"""
Test suite for Tasks/vanity_roles.py::compute_windowed_stats.

Regression cover for members who joined inside the scoring window. The task used to
run its own baseline lookup that returned None whenever a member had no snapshot
from exactly `window_days` ago, and skipped those members outright — so every recent
joiner was silently excluded from vanity roles no matter how much they contributed.

Tests:
1. A member who joined mid-window is scored from their first post-join snapshot
2. An established member's delta is unchanged by the fix
3. A member with no snapshot yet this membership is skipped, not given a 0 baseline
4. A returning member is not credited progress from a previous membership
