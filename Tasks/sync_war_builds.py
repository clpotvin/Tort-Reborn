"""Keep the website's war builds and the Discord war roles in agreement.

The two sides hold different amounts of detail. The database records which
*build* a member runs (``guardian`` pinned to v2.0, say); Discord only records
the coarse role that build implies. So the sync is asymmetric:

* database -> Discord is a faithful projection: a member holds ``Tank`` exactly
  when they have at least one *active* build whose definition has role
  ``TANK``. Archived builds and archived versions (TAQ-29) don't count: the
  assignment rows are kept as the record of who had them, but they produce no
  role, receive no new assignments, and are ignored when a human removes a
  role in Discord.
* Discord -> database is lossy: someone adding ``Tank`` by hand can only mean
  "give them the default tank build", and removing it means "drop their tank
  builds".

Both directions are supported, but only the reconciler writes anything. The
gateway listener never touches the database -- it just flags the member so the
next tick can re-derive both sides from authoritative state. Every role write
the reconciler makes is registered with the echo suppressor first, so the
gateway event it provokes is recognised as our own work rather than mistaken
for a human edit. Without that, the two halves treat each other's writes as
instructions and oscillate, deleting real build assignments on the way.
